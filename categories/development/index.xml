      <description>1998 - 2007 : Geocities and Shitty Spaghetti My name is Patrick Curl, I&amp;rsquo;ve been developing websites since geocities was a thing. I&amp;rsquo;ve installed and configured tons of scripts from hotscripts over the years. For a very long time I was a script junky but never really taught myself to &amp;lsquo;code&amp;rsquo;.
Sure, I could hack shit together and spew out spaghetti code, but really I was just good at tweaking scripts/interfaces that other&amp;rsquo;s put together and fixing broken things.</description>
