<p>My name is Patrick Curl, I've been developing websites since geocities was a thing. I've installed and configured tons of scripts from hotscripts over the years. For a very long time I was a script junky but never really taught myself to 'code'. </p>
<p>Sure, I could hack shit together and spew out spaghetti code, but really I was just good at tweaking scripts/interfaces that other's put together and fixing broken things. </p>
<h1>2008 : Wordpress, SEO, and Cooler Shit</h1>
<p>I picked up wordpress and managed sites for people more as an SEO marketer and social media consultant from about 2008-2012. </p>
<h1>2011-2013 : Ruby on Rails and What the Laravel?</h1>
<p>Around 2011 I got into Ruby on Rails, I started with going through all the codeschool, ruby monk, and other online walk-through tutorials. </p>
<p>in 2013 I got my first job writing Ruby code, ironically two weeks in they wanted to pivot to PHP because they were cheapskates and wanted to host on shared hosting. (Ironically traffic forced us to a vps 2 months later, but that's another story). I spent the first 2 weeks on a rails app, and the next week I ported it to Laravel 4.2. </p>
<p>I'd looked at laravel back when it was 3.* but it really didn't stand out, 4.2 though was extremely polished, dependency injection was way better, and the ecosystem was booming. Moving all my thought processes over to laravel from rails was pretty easy, and I began to love Laravel. </p>
<h1>2013-Present All in on Laravel</h1>
<p>I still like ruby syntax a bit better than php - but somehow I always jump to laravel first as my framework of choice. </p>
<p>This might change soon though, I've been using django with Django Rest Framework + React on the frontend for a project and I'm really liking the work flow, it took me a long time to get used to where everything was in django, Laravel/Rails have a very similar directory structure and coding style - python/django flips things up a bit. </p>
<h1>Now hire me!</h1>
<p>I'm currently looking for short or long-term freelance contracts, if you know anyone hiring let me know -- I also give referral kickbacks! </p>
